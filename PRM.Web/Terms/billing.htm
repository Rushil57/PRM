            <p>
                You authorize CareBlue, its affiliates, your medical provider’s organization and
                the financial institution designated to deduct payments from your account by either
                using information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer from your
                account or to process the transaction as a check. When we use information from your
                check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account
                as soon as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check
                back from your institution. You certify you have sufficient funds in the account
                provided for all electronic debit entries. Electronic debit entries shall be initiated
                by CareBlue to pay provider service charges and other charges and fees, including,
                if applicable, any fee charged to finance owed amounts that are not paid in full
                by the due date, for or associated with the above listed statements or other invoices
                as authorized and the entries shall constitute your receipt for the transaction(s).
                No payment to CareBlue shall be deemed to have been made unless and until CareBlue
                receives actual credit. You also understand that if a correction of any entry is
                necessary, it may involve an adjustment to your account. You understand your direct
                electronic payment of the amounts shown on your billing schedule will be debited
                on or after the due date indicated on that schedule and that you should continue
                to pay any paper bills you are sent prior to receiving the schedule. You understand
                that you will thereafter be sent a schedule only after your claim has been adjudicated
                by your insurance carrier or if your estimated amount changes during the scheduled
                payment period. CareBlue reserves the right to refuse or terminate electronic payments
                services. This agreement is to remain in effect until CareBlue terminates it or
                until you call 1-866-220-2500 to notify CareBlue in writing of termination or, if
                you are a registered web portal user, you can log on to the careblue.com/pay site
                and request removal. You understand CareBlue has 5 business days to act on your
                request. You understand that you have the right to contact your financial institution
                to place a one-time stop payment.

                <p>
                    I authorize CareBlue, its affiliates, my medical provider’s organization and the
                    credit card issuer for the card designated above to charge my credit card or the
                    card I, or my card issuer, replace it with. I understand that my card issuer can
                    supply CareBlue with updated expiration date and/or credit card number. It is my
                    responsibility to update CareBlue when the credit card and/or expiration date change.
                    I have a valid credit card listed above and for all charges have available credit
                    to accept such charges. Charges shall be initiated by CareBlue to pay provider service
                    charges and other charges and fees, including, if applicable, any fee charged to
                    finance owed amounts that are not paid in full by the due date, for or associated
                    with the above listed statements or other invoices as authorized and the entries
                    shall constitute my receipt for the transaction(s). No payment to CareBlue shall
                    be deemed to have been made unless and until CareBlue receives payment. I also understand
                    that if corrections of the entry are necessary, it may involve an adjustment to
                    my account. I understand the charge to my card of the billing schedule amount will
                    be charged on or after the due date indicated on my schedule and that I should continue
                    to pay any paper bills I am sent prior to receiving the schedule. I understand that
                    I will thereafter be sent a schedule only after my claim has been adjudicated by
                    my insurance carrier or if my estimated amount changes during the scheduled payment
                    period. CareBlue reserves the right to refuse or terminate automatic payments services.
                    This agreement is to remain in effect until CareBlue terminates it or until I call
                    1-866-220-2500, notify CareBlue in writing of termination or, if I am a registered

                    <h3>
                        Billing and Refund Policy</h3>
                    <p>
                        If your insurance pays more than the estimated amount, a refund will be process
                        within 15 days from the date payment is received from your insurance company. Often
                        times, insurance companies will send an Explanation of Benefits to the patient before
                        remitting payment to us. Once the insurance payment is processed by our billing
                        service, a patient refund will be issued. If a refund is in order, it will be processed
                        via the same method as the original payment or, at our discretion, a check may be
                        issued to you. If payment was made by credit card, we will credit your account.
                        While every effort is made to provide refunds in a timely fashion, your financial
                        institution may take several days to reflect refund transactions. Please allow 7-10
                        days for a credit to appear on your credit card statement after a credit is made.
                        If payment was made by check, the refund check will be mailed within 15 days. If
                        your insurance pays less than the estimated amount, you will receive a statement
                        in the mail or by email if you elected to receive electronic correspondence. Upon
                        notification of an outstanding balance, the total amount is due from the patient.
                        Your cooperation with this is greatly appreciated. Please note, if your insurance
                        company does not remit payment to us after submitting a claim, the patient will
                        be responsible for the entire balance for services rendered. Patients can then contact
                        their insurance carrier to obtain reimbursement directly. Any unpaid balances beyond
                        30 days will be subject to late fees and finance charges. If you elect to save credit
                        card, debit card or checking methods of payment for future use or as part of an
                        automatic payment or credit plan, CareBlue may occasionally re-verify the validity
                        of those account with your card issuer or financial institution after long periods
                        of inactivity.
