                <br />
                The Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, regulates how credit reporting agencies and others 
                handle information about consumers. FCRA also impacts those who receive information about consumers 
                like you, a "verifier", or a user of Transunion Patient Financial Summary services.
                <br />
                <br />
                CareBlue PracticeAdvance (CBPA) and Transunion requires the privacy and rights of patients be maintained. 
                All credit inquiries must be made in compliance with the FTC Fair Credit Reporting Act.
                Each member of your practice who is authorized for Patient Financial Summary inquiries must 
                understand the consumer protection requirements set forth in this regulation. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Here are two of the most important obligations:
                <br />
                <br />
                1.  Your identity must be confirmed. Before you use Transunion Patient Financial Summary services, your 
                organization must go through a credentialing process to establish that you have the right to receive information. 
                Each time you use Transunion Patient Financial Summary services, you must go through a secure log in process that 
                may require you to answer security questions to prove your identity.
                <br />
                <br />
                2.  You must declare your Permissible Purpose. All users of the system must declare their reason for 
                receiving the information. In FCRA terms, this reason is called a Permissible Purpose.
                <br />
                <br />
                Please remember, these are only two FCRA requirements out of many. You should carefully review the 
                Terms and Conditions of the service for complete details about your obligations when using Transunion Patient 
                Financial Summary services. For more information, you may also contact the the FTC or refer to the the following website:
