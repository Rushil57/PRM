                CareBlue PracticeAdvance (CBPA) respects the privacy of its customers, subscribers,
                and visitors. If you have any questions about the operation of our website, please
                write to info@careblue.com.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our website collects names, email addresses, and other personal information from
                customers, subscribers, and visitors only when submitted via one of our online forms,
                such as our subscription form, assessment registration or help desk support form.
                This data is used solely by CBPA and is NEVER shared, traded, or sold to third parties.
                <br />
                <br />
                Customers can edit their personal information by clicking on the 'profile' link
                located in the upper right corner of our help desk site. Registrants can un-register
                by writing to the email address above or by using the 'un-subscribe' link at the
                bottom of any promotional mailing.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our website also collects non-personal data through the use of server-based "session
                variables," which we use to achieve important site functionality, including the
                recognition of logged-in users. In order to identify customers as they proceed through
                the help desk site, our website also uses a single “cookie” (a small file stored
                by your browser on your hard drive); thus, online support tickets require a browser
                that accepts “cookies.”
                <br />
                <br />
                Our web-server also records IP addresses from all visitors to our site. An IP address
                is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.
                We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our
                site, to analyze trends, to track user movement, and to gather broad demographic
                information — all for the purpose of continually improving our website and delivering
                personalized, custom content. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable
                information, and their collection is standard procedure in most web-server environments.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our website contains links to other websites. Please note that when you click on
                one of these links, you are entering another website, for which CBPA is not responsible.

                By using careblue.com and prm.careblue.com, you signify your agreement to our privacy
                policy as stated above. Note that this policy may be revised periodically without
                notice. Please re-read this policy prior to submitting any personal information
                if you have concerns about how your information is being collected and used.
