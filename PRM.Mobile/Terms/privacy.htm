                            CareBlue PracticeAdvance (CBPA) respects the privacy of its customers, subscribers,
                            and visitors. If you have any questions about the operation of our website, please
                            write to info@careblue.com.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Our website collects names, email addresses, and other personal information from
                            customers, subscribers, and visitors only when submitted via one of our online forms,
                            such as our subscription form, assessment registration or help desk support form.
                            This data is used solely by CBPA and is NEVER shared, traded, or sold to third parties.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Customers can edit their personal information by clicking on the 'profile' link
                            located in the upper right corner of our help desk site. Registrants can un-register
                            by writing to the email address above or by using the 'un-subscribe' link at the
                            bottom of any promotional mailing.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Our website also collects non-personal data through the use of server-based "session
                            variables," which we use to achieve important site functionality, including the
                            recognition of logged-in users. In order to identify customers as they proceed through
                            the help desk site, our website also uses a single “cookie” (a small file stored
                            by your browser on your hard drive); thus, online support tickets require a browser
                            that accepts “cookies.”
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Our web-server also records IP addresses from all visitors to our site. An IP address
                            is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.
                            We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our
                            site, to analyze trends, to track user movement, and to gather broad demographic
                            information — all for the purpose of continually improving our website and delivering
                            personalized, custom content. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable
                            information, and their collection is standard procedure in most web-server environments.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Our website contains links to other websites. Please note that when you click on
                            one of these links, you are entering another website, for which CBPA is not responsible.
